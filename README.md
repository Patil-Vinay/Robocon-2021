The robot has a robotic arm with a degree of freedom of 4 and has a universal gripper as one of itâ€™s links. This gripper is pneumatically operated by a 100ml syringe. Arrows can be picked up from ground and the robotic arm can place it in the arrow shooting channel or can drop the arrow in the outer area for TR to pick it up.

TR also has the same robotic arm and universal gripper to pick up arrows from the arrow stand and ground.
An additional feature for TR is that it can store 5 arrows in a round container and one on the arrow shooting channel. The container can rotate (except the outer shell) and one arrow from the container is dropped on the arrow channel using a servo operated flap.
The robotic arm will place the arrow in the top wider region. The arrow then slide down and get placed in the revolving chamber.
The red plates rotate. When the arrow is at the lowest position, a servo operated flap opens to make the arrow fall onto the shooting channel.
The motor mounted on the bottom of the shooting channel will pull the grey coloured pushing part and stretch the springs. Now the arrow can be shot.
